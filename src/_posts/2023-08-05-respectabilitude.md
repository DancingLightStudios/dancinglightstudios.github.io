In a Sentence: “At Dancing Light Studios, respectabilatude is more than just a core value; it's a practice that defines how team members engage with each other and their clients.”\

Thank you to Jesse Schell for putting a word on it. At Dancing Light, sincere respectabilatude is one of our core values. It is one of the key components we look for in team members and something we foster within the organization. It's a philosophy that encourages us to approach each other's ideas with curiosity and appreciation, to strive for what's 'technologically meaningful and impactful.'\

Respectabilatude allows us to break barriers in AR, VR, and projection-mapped location-based entertainment, not by creating a hierarchy of ideas but by celebrating the diversity of thought. From daily team collaborations to our extended relationships with clients, respectabilatude guides us to create an environment where diverse opinions are cherished, and everyone's voice matters. It's a living value that makes us more than just colleagues – we're a community.
